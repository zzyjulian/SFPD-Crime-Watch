# SFPD-Crime-Watch
Final Project for COMM 273


FEEDBACK FROM SERDAR
This is a solid set of questions paired with a readily available set of data. It’s critical that you begin working with the data immediately if you haven’t already (i.e. during class today). Here is a set of discrete tasks for you to begin with:
Create a new GitHub repository
Go to Settings -> Collaborators on the new repository, click “Add people” and add my username (zstumgoren).
Open a Codespace and perform the usual environment setup, detailed in this video
Once the codespace is set up, create a new Jupyter notebook (e.g. sf_crime.ipynb)
Working in the new notebook, write code to do the following initial steps:
Use the requests library to fetch a copy of the SF data and create a new file inside your codespace where the file is saved
Use pandas to read in the data
Convert any date fields you plan to use to proper datetime objects
Once those steps are complete, you should proceed with attempting to perform the analyses in pandas to address the quantifiable questions you laid out below.

-How has the crime rate in SF changed over time from 2018 to 2025?
-What type of crimes have changed most drastically? 
-Which neighborhoods or police districts experienced the sharpest changes in crime rates?
-How do key events, social moments, or policy changes affect the crime pattern?
-What specific time of the year, month have seen the highest numbers of reported crime, and what are some of the potential reasons behind it?
